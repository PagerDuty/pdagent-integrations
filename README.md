# Introduction

This project contains integrations for various monitoring tools with the
PagerDuty Agent.

It currently include support for:

- Nagios
- Sensu
- Zabbix

## Developing

See the Agent project at https://github.com/PagerDuty/pdagent for setup
instructions for Pydev, IntelliJ IDEA, Docker.

See the file `zabbix-testing.txt` for Zabbix build and test instructions,
`nagios-testing.txt` for Nagios build and test instructions, and the file
`sensu-testing.txt` for Sensu build and test instructions.


### Building Packages

Follow the same steps as in the Agent project. (there is no `SVC_KEY` in
`pdagenttestinteg/util.sh` to edit)

### Zabbix Testing

The integration test for Zabbix only runs standalone tests for the `pd-zabbix`
command line script. You should also test actual Zabbix integration using the
public Zabbix Integration Guide.

For details, see `zabbix-testing.txt`.


### Release Packages

Follow the same steps as in the Agent project.
